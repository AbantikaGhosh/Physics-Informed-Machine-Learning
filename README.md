Artificial Neural Nets that incorporate Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis into Loss Function


- Run "generateRCWAdata.m"; this will generate a datafile called dataFull.mat
- copy this file to m=50 folder
- Run "annRun.mat"; this will create a file ANNtest.mat, containing the trained network
- Run "annTest.mat" to test the performance of the resulting ANN
